#### Course Description

This is an advanced course in natural language understanding. It focuses on
methods for learning linguistic representations, at all levels of analysis: 
words, syntax, semantics, and discourse. The methods will mainly be 
probabilistic models, and it will emphasize the use of modern deep
learning techniques in their design. We will cover applications of these
models in a range of natural language understanding tasks such as 
language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, question answering, 
semantic parsing, sentiment analysis, and discourse coherence.

#### Prerequisites

This is not an introductory course. You **must** have taken and passed 
previous courses in these two areas.

1. Natural language processing: [ANLP](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/anlp/) or [FNLP](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/fnlp/).
1. Machine learning: [IAML](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/iaml), [MLPR](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/), or [MLP](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/). If your only machine learning course is MLP and you are taking it concurrently with NLU, you should be **very** comfortable with it after semester 1.

If you've taken these prerequisites and done well in them then you will be 
well-prepared for NLU, and if you're excited about these areas then I 
encourage you to take it.

If you have not taken previous courses in both natural language processing and
machine learning, or if you took them but did poorly or didn't enjoy them, then you should
not take NLU.

#### Time and Place

- Tuesdays 15:10--16:00, 50 George Square, Lecture theatre G.03
- Fridays 15:10--16:00, Medical School, Teviot lecture theatre, doorway 5

Lectures will be recorded and made available through the university's
lecture capture service.

#### Teaching Team

- [Adam Lopez](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alopez/), course lecturer
- [Marco Damonte](http://mdtux89.github.io/)
- [Federico Fancellu](https://ffancellu.github.io/)
- [Ida Szubert](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/students/Katarzyna_Szubert.html)
- [Clara Vania](https://claravania.github.io/)

#### Assessment

Assessment will consist of:

1. A coursework, due in week 7, worth 30%. I encourage you to work in pairs---you'll learn more that way.
1. A final exam in the April/ May diet, worth 70%.

The course will follow the school-wide [late coursework policy](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests). 
To request an extension on your coursework, [contact the ITO](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/contacts). 
If you contact me, I will simply redirect you to them, because I am not empowered to grant extensions myself.

The course will follow the [academic conduct policy](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct). 
I take this policy seriously: in 2017 I referred 22 students for academic misconduct, including collustion and plagiarism. 
I don't enjoy doing this, but I will do it without hesitation if you violate 
the policy, so please familiarize yourself with it.

#### Feedback and help

Through the course, you will receive feedback in several ways:

- Short, non-assessed quizzes, to test your understanding.
- Feedforward sessions for the coursework, where you will can ask questions. 
- Coursework assessment within two weeks of the due date.
- A sample solution for the coursework, released after the deadline.

You can also seek additional help. We offer:

- A weekly in-person office hour Fridays 2-3, starting week 3. Location TBD.
- A weekly online office hour, Wednesdays 3-4, starting week 3. Details TBD.
- A [piazza](piazza.com/ed.ac.uk/spring2018/infr11061/home) forum. The teaching team will
  monitor the forum for unanswered questions **once a day, Monday through Friday**,
  usually in the afternoon. **You are encouraged to answer other students' questions**,
  since if you can answer someone's question, you know the material. We will
  correct any misunderstandings during our daily review.

If you have a question, please use one of these methods! **Don't** email me---I recently 
[crossed the email event horizon](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=388), 
so your email is likely to languish in my inbox for a long time before I 
see it. You will get a much
faster response using the methods above.
